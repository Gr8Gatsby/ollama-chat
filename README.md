# Ollama Chat

A chat client designed to bring software ideas to life quickly through conversation.

## Vision

This project explores a new way to build software—one that bridges the gap between "vibe coding" and building real knowledge. Through an intuitive chat interface, you can turn ideas into working code while learning about what's being built for you along the way.

## Key Features

- **Quick Prototyping**: Transform ideas into working software through natural conversation
- **Learning-First UX**: Designed to help you understand what's being built, not just generate code
- **AI-Native**: Built from the ground up with AI coding assistants as first-class collaborators
- **Powered by Ollama**: Local-first AI for privacy and control

## Built with AI

This project is developed in collaboration with AI coding tools, embracing a modern workflow where human creativity and AI capability work hand-in-hand.
