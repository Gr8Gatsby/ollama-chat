# Functional Specification

## Overview

Ollama Chat is a chat client designed to help people build software through conversation. The focus is on bridging the gap between quick ideation ("vibe coding") and building genuine understanding of what's being created.

## Vision & Goals

### Primary Goal
Provide a quick way to bring software ideas to life while ensuring users learn about what's being built for them.

### Key Principles
1. **Speed to Value**: Minimize friction between idea and working software
2. **Learning Through Building**: The UX should teach users about their software as it's created
3. **Knowledge Bridge**: Connect the intuitive flow of conversation with deeper technical understanding
4. **AI-Native Experience**: Designed from the ground up for human-AI collaboration
